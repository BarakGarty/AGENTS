How to Use the AGENTS Model

(1) Download and Extract:
Download the provided ZIP file and extract its contents to a folder on your PC.
You also require to pre-install NetLogo 6.4.0 version desktop application in order to be able to run netlogo code (https://ccl.northwestern.edu/netlogo/download.shtml)

(2) Included Files:
- The .nlogo file: The main model file.
- External files and folders: Required for the model's operation.
- Guides: A dedicated folder with detailed instructions and tutorials.
- ODD file: Comprehensive documentation following the Overview, Design concepts, and Details protocol.

(3) Getting Started:
- Refer to the ODD file (PDF) for detailed information about the model's purpose, entities, processes, and design concepts.
- Additionally, use the guides in the 'guides' folder for a deeper understanding of the UI components and the usage of external files:
1. Using and modifying external CSV files for the model.
2. Preparing GIS datasets for the AGENTS model.
3. Navigating the main user interface (UI) components.
